# ADC121s101_Data-acquirement-from-ADC-to-VHDL-via-BASYS-3
In this code through ADC121S101 data given from external signal generator or voltage regulator , will be conveyed to the block memeory design. 
ADC interface has 12 bits to work. 
Before working on code,  reading ADC's manual is recommended. 
12.5 MHz ADC clock is used. And ADC sampling rate is 500K sample per second.
Also, in this code, 15626 samples are written onto Block Meory design so decimation process is implemented.
